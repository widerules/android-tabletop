So, what can we see here.

On top is a usual chess board. But why that sets of figures below?

That's a "palette" of game pieces. You can take pieces from there and frop on table. If you don't want pieces on table anymore - drop them back to palette and they will disappeared.

So, you can play chess (only with yourself or in a "hot seat" mode, but that will change very soon). Or try to place 8 Queens so they don't threat each other, or about anything else you can possibly do with a chess board and with a set (practically infinite) of chess pieces.
