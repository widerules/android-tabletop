#summary Description of visual engine

Visual Engine is built to be flexible and comfy.

It can show game accessories on screen, and interpret user's action. Now primary way to do moves is moving pieces - first you click on a piece to move, and then where you want it. Depending on moved piece and target, different actions can happen - piece can be just moved, or copied to a new place, or replace a piece it is dropped on. Rules for that are described in XmlFormat.
