#summary Description of visual engine

Visual Engine is built to be flexible and comfy.

It can show game accessories on screen, and interpret user's action. Now primary way to do moves is moving pieces - first you click on a piece to move, and then where you want it. Depending on moved piece and target, different actions can happen - piece can be just moved, or copied to a new place, or replace a piece it is dropped on. Rules for that are described in XmlFormat.

For example: on first picture black piece is moved over white piece, on second white piece is removed from game.

Means to made game moved more automated (highlighting correct moves, preventing illegal moves,  automating complex game actions like removing captured piece claster in go) are limited now. In future it will be possible to set a very complex rules with plug-ins and scripting languages.

Also, following Gui features are planned:

 # Making moves with keyboard only
 # Scaling and scrolling game field for big tables
 # More game widgets - fully functional card sets, dices, notes (for word games, for example)
